<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Ploot will help you create teams for PvP-games like Overwatch in your discord server. You can add, remove players or spectators, randomize two teams of 6 people and move them into designated voice channels when you start/end the match.
No more using randomize websites and moving each player back and forth one by one!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanleminh/ploot.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Enter your configuration in `config.json`
4. Run with

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Start a new session with `=newsession` - You can now add/remove players or any other functionality that comes with ploot. Add a player or spectator (or multiple!) with `=addplayer @DiscordUser ...` or `=addspectator @DiscordUser ...` respectively or remove them with `=remove @DiscordUser ...`.
You can then create your teams by using the `=randomizer` command - It will purge any players not present in the lobby. Then you can use `=startmatch` to move every player in the lobby to their designated voice-channel and back to the lobby with `=endmatch`.
Finally, you can end the session with `=endsession`.

For more commands, check out the `=help` command!
